Following is a partlist for one PSU and one display unit.
The list contains the amount, the name and the digikey order number, if available, of the part needed

WARNING!
Most parts are SMT components.
If you do not have any experience with SMT soldering,
please do not use them.
Most are also available in a through hole package.
For those that aren't, alternatives are available.
WARNING!

INFO!
Please note that i happened to come across a VFD
display for my project.
Since i do not have any information about it except 
for what i found out by poking around at it,
you will not be able to find the same display.
You can use any display you like if you know how to 
interface it.
Easiest way to go are HD44780 compatible displays.
If you're a bit fancy, you can go for ones with a
serial interface (I2C, SPI, RS232, etc.)
